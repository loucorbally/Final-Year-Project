    <ion-title>North Pole</ion-title>
    <ion-card-content>
      The first themed level which we created had a Christmas theme. We were aiming to have the level in a fully
      functional state by the 30th of November for our project prototype. We achieved this goal and the level acted as a
      proof of concept. The level demonstrated that the game had potential and with the addition of extra levels we
      could produce the full maze game that we wanted.

    <ion-title>Beach</ion-title>
    <ion-card-content>
      After giving the first level a wintery Christmas theme we wanted to create a polar opposite level as our second
      level. We designed a sunny beach and created lots of assets in blender to block the player’s path and create a
      maze.

    <ion-title>Farm</ion-title>
    <ion-card-content>
      The third level we produced was themed around farming. The farm environment offered lots of opportunity for
      creating assets and animations to bring the level to life and fully immerse the player.

    <ion-title>The HUB</ion-title>
    <ion-card-content>
      We considered that the transition between each of the levels made the game slightly disjointed (e.g. the
      north-pole level ends and the player is dropped into the beach level with no explanation of what happened). To
      combat this and make the gaming experience more understandable and interesting from the player’s perspective we
      added a hub level which ties all of the levels together. The hub level is where the player begins the game. The
      level was created to appear like a traditional hedge maze. Unlike the other levels this level does not have a
      timer or coins present. What this level does have however is portals. These portals were created through
      animation, unity particle systems and spotlights. Each portal has its own corresponding level in the hub level.
