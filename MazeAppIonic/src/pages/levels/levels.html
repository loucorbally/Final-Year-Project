      The first themed level which we created had a Christmas theme. <br>
      We were aiming to have the level in a fully functional state by the 30th of November for our project prototype. <br>
      We achieved this goal and the level acted as a proof of concept. <br>
      The level demonstrated that the game had potential and with the addition of extra levels we could produce the full maze game that we wanted.

      After giving the first level a wintery Christmas theme we wanted to create a polar opposite level as our second
      level.<br> We designed a sunny beach and created lots of assets in blender to block the player’s path and create a
      maze.

    <ion-card-content>
      The third level we produced was themed around farming. <br> The farm environment offered lots of opportunity for
      creating assets and animations to bring the level to life and fully immerse the player.

    <ion-card-content>
      We considered that the transition between each of the levels made the game slightly disjointed  (e.g. the
      north-pole level ends and the player is dropped into the beach level with no explanation of what happened). <br>To
      combat this and make the gaming experience more understandable and interesting from the player’s perspective we
      added a hub level which ties all of the levels together.  <br> The hub level is where the player begins the game. The
      level was created to appear like a traditional hedge maze. <br> Unlike the other levels this level does not have a
      timer or coins present. <br> What this level does have however is portals. These portals were created through
      animation, unity particle systems and spotlights. <br> Each portal has its own corresponding level in the hub level.
