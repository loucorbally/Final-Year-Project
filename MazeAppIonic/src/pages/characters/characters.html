        <h2><b>Elf</b></h2>
        <p>The first character to be created was the elf.
          <br>
          The model was simple and blocky as we believed that this would suit the aesthetic of the games levels and may
          be easier to animate.
          <br>
          The arms and legs were animated so that alternate arms and legs would be moving forward and backwards on each
          key frame.
          <br>
          The elf so that he would <b>follow the player</b> around the scene.
          <br>
          When a collide was added to the elf this further added to the difficulty level of the game
          as the elf will force the player as backtracking will force the player to have to navigate
          <br>
          their way around an elf which is going to continue to follow them wherever they go in the maze. </p>

        <h2><b>Snowman</b></h2>
        <p>
          The very first animation which was created was for the snowman in the winter level.
          <br>
          This should have been one of the more straightforward animations due to the lack of arms or legs but the final
          model for the snowman had
          sticks for arms
          <br>
          which needed to be animated moving up and down as he moved.
          <br>
          We planned to move the snowman as if he was patrolling a corridor. This meant that we could loop the animation
          when he had done a full loop of
          the corridor.
          <br>
          The animation appears very straightforward in Unity, but we ran into some problems creating it
          in blender.
          <br>
          The arms of the snowman were meant to move up and down along on of the axis is blender but as we
          key framed the turning animation the axis were changing which made
          <br>
          it very difficult to measure the animation
          of the arms for it to appear natural and consistent with the rest of the animation.

        <h2><b>Santa</b></h2>
        <p>The Santa Claus was the next character which was animated using the alternate limb animation system which we
          had established for animating humanoid characters.
          <br>
          The Santa character model was much more complex than the elf. The hair, beard and hat were particularly
          difficult to create.
          <br>
          After watching multiple tutorial videos for creating cartoon-like hair in blender we attempted to create
          something which looked suitable for the model.
          <br>
          Each strand of hair was crafted with grooves before being sized and rotated to fit together to form a complete
          hair and beard.
          <br>
          The resulting hair and beard really stood out and completed the character’s model. We also researched how a
          ball for the end of the hat could be created.

        <h2><b>Fish</b></h2>
        <p>The fish was very frustrating to create.
          <br>
          The model was created with the use of the mirror modifier as the shape of the fish was exactly symmetrical.
          <br>
          This meant that if we only needed to model half of the fish and the other half would be modelled as a mirror
          image.
          <br>
          The animation process for the fish was unique as we wanted the fish to loop in a circle before leaping out of
          <br>
          the water ending the animation with the exact
          orientation and position that it started.
          <br>
          The fish also required a second animation through the use of an armature bone.
          <br>
          The bone was placed so that it was running parallel to the fish centred on its y and z axes.
          <br>
          An animation was created so that the bone bended left and right repeatedly to mimic the action that the fish’s
          body would make to propel itself through the water.
          <br>
          The animation was very realistic and was actually the most realistic animation that we created over the course
          of the full project.</p>

        <h2><b>Walrus</b></h2>
        <p>Many of the objects required smooth edges and a reduced polygon count (e.g. Beachball and Walrus).
          <br>
          To achieve this, we created edge loops to parts of the models and added subdivision surface modifiers.
          <br>
          The subdivision surface modifiers were very useful in allowing us to significantly reduce the polygon count on
          the objects and lessen the workload on the renderer to help
          <br>
          reduce in-game lagging.

        <h2><b>Crab</b></h2>
        <p>
          The crab was created in blender with the animation process at the forefront of our thoughts when designing the
          model.
          <br>
          The crab was given six legs so that key framing the walking animation would be created by moving the middle
          leg alternatingly with the two outer legs.
          <br>
          When the middle left leg was down the front and back left legs were raised. The opposite movement was created
          for the other side of the crab.
          <br>
          The arms were made long so that the movement would seem exaggerated. The decision to create different sized
          eyes for the crab which sat on top of
          <br>
          different length antennae was made to make the crab look less symmetrical and add character to the model.
          <br>
          The final animation was incorrect when first imported into Unity.
          <br> Some of the crab’s objects which were animated correctly in Blender were disconnected from the crab and
          in different positions in Unity.
          <br>
          The animation needed to be completely restarted in Blender.

        <h2><b>Towels</b></h2>
        <p>There were quite a few problems encountered when we tried creating objects such as the towels and cloth for
          the deckchairs.
          <br>
          The process of animating the towel was very slow and involved converting the flat brick-like object into a
          cloth.
          <br>
          A modifier was used to enable blender to identify the object as a cloth.
          <br>
          The cloth then needed to be edited in vertex mode so that vertices could be constrained by using weight paint.
          <br>
          Instead of creating an animation it instead created a simulation for how a cloth material would behave.
          <br>
          After altering sliders such as bounce and stiffness the simulation acted like n accurate representation of how
          a towel would move.</p>

        <h2><b>Boat</b></h2>
        <p>By creating different controllers running the animations at different speeds we were able to desynchronise
          the objects animations and make them appear more realistic.
          <br>
          This can be seen on the boats in the water in the summer level.
          <br>
          The boats all appear to be moving in the water in different directions depending on the movement of the waves,
          however this is not the case.
          <br>
          The boats have the same animation applied to them, but the animations are running at different speeds as they
          are controlled by separate animator controllers.
          <br>
          This animation technique was also utilised for the buoys that we created to float in water.

        </ion-thumbnail>
        <h2><b>Pig</b></h2>
        <p>The pig was easier to animate but we did encounter a lot of problems with the ears.
          <br>Like so many other
          objects which we made normalising faces was the problem.
          <br>
          As the player approached the pig from the front the
          ears would be completely see through as none of the inside faces of the pig’s ear would be rendered.<br>
          To
          counteract this, we tried the duplication method, but this failed so we tried to use other methods which would
          cause the full geometry of the pig’s ear to be rendered.
          <br>
          We tried changing the normal of the ear to inside
          facing normal but predictably this ensured that the outer face of the ear wasn’t rendered.
          <br> We solved the
          problem by duplicating small parts of the ear and reversing the normal so that the player can’t see through
          the ear.
          <br>
          The duplicated parts needed to be scaled down so that the edges aren’t protruding through the
          original faces.
          <br>
          The new faces did solve the problem but as the faces were scaled down it was impossible to
          completely cover the other face without slightly intersecting the original faces. </p>

        <h2><b>Sheep</b></h2>
        <p>The sheep was created in blender with a sphere object acting as the main component.
          <br>We first viewed wool sheep-like textures that could be applied to the sphere but then decided we could
          alter the composition of the
          sphere itself to look more like a sheep.
          <br>To make the sphere look fluffy we brought the sphere into edit mode and individually extruded each of the
          faces of the sphere.
          <br>This was an extremely arduous repetitive task as all of the faces couldn’t be extruded together or even in
          groups as this would fail to leave the gaps between
          the faces.
          <br>
          The finished model did have a fluffy look, but it wasn’t the exact effect that we had been hoping for.
          <br>
          The head was designed using a cube which had lots of edge loops added so that we could sculpt the shape of it
          and add more faces before it was subdivided.
          <br>
          A mirror modifier was added so that the two ears and eyes of the sheep were evenly modelled.
          <br>
          The ears were pulled out down and back to try and replicate how the ears of the sheep would appear tight to
          its head. </p>

        <h2><b>Chicken</b></h2>
        <p>The chicken was created in blender after viewing several 3D models of chicken for inspiration.
          <br>
          We looked at a mobile game called crossy roads which also features a chicken, but the model is very blocky,
          and this didn’t suit the style of our game.
          <br>
          We instead decided to keep the model very rounded so that it would fit the style being used for the rest of
          the scene. The body of the chicken was difficult to shape correctly.
          <br>
          A cylinder was the original object used.
          <br>
          The cylinder was turned at a 45-degree angle before subdivision surface modifiers were used to create a
          suitable shape.
          <br>
          A lot of the 3d models that we had viewed were designed so that the chickens head had spike like hairs
          protruding from the top of their head and <br>
          something similar below its beak, so we opted to do the same.
          <br>
          The feet were deliberately left very blocky because we felt that it did a much better job of representing how
          a chicken’s talons would look.
          <br>
          Animating the chicken was a fun exercise which consisted of animating the legs forward alternatingly.
          <br>
          We also tried to add extra life to the animation by animating the wings of the chicken jutting in and out as
          it walked and the head moving from side to side.
          <br>
          The resulting animation showed the chicken moving fully during its walk cycle rather than appearing to be
          paralysed from the mid-section up which is so <br> often the case when animations are only created for the
          legs.
          <br>
          The extra movement adds realism to the characters model and makes the animation more believable.

        <h2><b>Tractor</b></h2>
        <p>The tractor was a very difficult model to build as while the main components of the model appear to be simple
          shapes the small details in the model was very arduous to complete.
          <br>
          To begin simple shapes such as cubes were
          put in the appropriate positions to represent where the finished pieces would sit.
          <br>
          This proved more difficult than expected with scale and perspective being major issues in the modelling
          process.
          <br>
          We tried to set the correct distance between the front tires and the back while allowing space for the frame
          of the tractor.
          <br>
          Gauging this distance was difficult and it took a lot of editing of the model to make the scale of the tractor
          look appropriate and not too long.
          <br>
          Once the frame was nearing completion extra edge loops were added to mark out where the windows and the frame
          would separate.
          <br>
          The windows were all separated from the frame and joined together to make it easier to add a glass material to
          the
          windows when the tractor was in unity.
          <br>The mudguards were also separated from the frame and joined together as
          their own object.
