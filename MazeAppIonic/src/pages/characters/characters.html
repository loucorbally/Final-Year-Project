            <h2><b>Elf</b></h2>
            <p>The first such character to be created was the elf. 
              <br>
              The model was simple and blocky as we believed that this would suit the aesthetic of the games levels and may be easier to animate. 
              <br>
               The arms and legs were animated so that alternate arms and legs would be moving forward and backwards on each key frame. 
               <br>
              The elf so that he would <b>follow the player</b> around the scene.
              <br>
              When a collide was added to the elf this further added to the difficulty level of the game 
              as the elf will force the player as backtracking will force the player to have to navigate 
              <br>
              their way around an elf which is going to continue to follow them wherever they go in the maze.   </p>

            <h2><b>Snowman</b></h2>
            <p>The very first animation which was created was for the snowman in the winter level. 
              <br>
              We planned to move the snowman as if he was patrolling a corridor. This would cause the user to have to move around the snowman.

              <img src="assets/img/santa1.png">
            </ion-thumbnail>
            <h2><b>Santa</b></h2>
            <p>The Santa Claus was the next character which was animated using the alternate limb animation system which we had established for animating humanoid characters. 
              <br>
               The Santa character model was much more complex than the elf. The hair, beard and hat were particularly difficult to create. 
              <br> 
               After watching multiple tutorial videos for creating cartoon-like hair in blender we attempted to create something which looked suitable for the model. 
              <br>
               Each strand of hair was crafted with grooves before being sized and rotated to fit together to form a complete hair and beard. 
              <br>
               The resulting hair and beard really stood out and completed the characterâ€™s model. We also researched how a ball for the end of the hat could be created.
