    <ion-card-title><b>The Concept</b></ion-card-title>



    <ion-card>
      <ion-card-content>
        The concept of Maze is simple. The player will be placed in one of our themed levels where they will need to
        navigate their way through the maze in order to find all of the coins before the timer runs out. If the timer
        runs out then the player will fail the level, the coins which they have already found will be taken away from
        them and then level will be restarted.
        <br>
        The Maze is brimming with animated characters and objects which bring the environment to life. Secrets and
        discoveries lie around every corner making each revisit to the Maze a new experience. The time constraint on the
        levels adds an element of pressure and panic to the game and this generates a more engaging, invested gameplay
        experience. Time is used as an easily comparable metric for measuring the player gameplay performance. This
        in-turn increases the replay value of the game as the player will be continually trying to better their previous
        play-through of the game and complete the levels in less time.
        <br>
        We endeavoured to strike a balance between an engaging enjoyable gameplay experience and a challenge which would
        test the player and force them to persevere in order to complete the game. We feel that the game is balanced in
        this respect due to the set of rules which have been created for the levels. As we said previously the player is
        given 60 seconds in the maze to collect all of the coins.

        The Rules of the Maze are simple.
        <br>
        Think of each level as a new story.

        1. You start in the HUB where you select your level.
        <br>
        2. You are dropped into the maze and the timer begins.
        <br>
        3. You must manouver the maze & find all the coins before the timer runs out.
        <br>
        4. If the timer reaches 0:00 and you have not found your way our of the maze & collect all the coins then its
        <b>GAME OVER</b>
        <br>
        5. You will be brought back to the hub where you can decided whether to take on the challenge again!
