        The concept of Maze is simple. The player will be placed in one of our themed levels where they will need to navigate their way through the maze in order to find all of the coins before the timer runs out. If the timer runs out then the player will fail the level, the coins which they have already found will be taken away from them and then level will be restarted.

            The Maze is brimming with animated characters and objects which bring the environment to life. Secrets and discoveries lie around every corner making each revisit to the Maze a new experience. The time constraint on the levels adds an element of pressure and panic to the game and this generates a more engaging, invested gameplay experience. Time is used as an easily comparable metric for measuring the player gameplay performance. This in-turn increases the replay value of the game as the player will be continually trying to better their previous play-through of the game and complete the levels in less time.

          We endeavoured to strike a balance between an engaging enjoyable gameplay experience and a challenge which would test the player and force them to persevere in order to complete the game. We feel that the game is balanced in this respect due to the set of rules which have been created for the levels. As we said previously the player is given 60 seconds in the maze to collect all of the coins.
